title: How to Feel Grateful

{{ page.title }}
================

Finally finally, I'm getting out of school. Graduation sometimes sounds so ordinary since everyone goes through it, but like all cycle-of-life events, for a single person, it's a huge thing. It's the first time that I won't have to go back to school after a summer. The first time when there will be nothing to study for and no homework to do. These are activities that I have, quite literally, been doing all my life.

I had 4 different offers for a full-time position, so I decided to take an entire day just to think about this decision, given that that it's one with so many consequences for my life. The impetus to take so much time out of my busy school schedule came from a persistent thought that's been floating around in my head: that <strong>we don't spend nearly enough time making decisions</strong>. The time taken to arrive at a decision is almost never proportional to the enormity of the decision. Think about it. When was the last time you spent more than an hour thinking about the same anything, let alone a decision? Spontaneaty certainly isn't a bad thing (picture the ridiculousness of writing out a list of good and bad points about every person you know in order to figure out who you ought to like most). But I felt there was something to this idea. I haven't tried this form of decision making ever before, so it seemed worth a shot.

There I was laboriously writing down meticulous reasons for and against each company. And as I pondered my options, I came to realize some crazy things:

1. Right out of college armed with nothing more than a bachelor's degree, as a 22-year-old kid, I'm going to be making <strong>more than double</strong> what my dad, who's been in the workforce for nearly 30 years, makes. Now, that's fucking crazy.
2. All of this despite being a slacker and not giving a fuck about grades since junior year of high school.
3. All because, for some reason, my dad decided to introduce me to computer hardware at 6, and for some reason, my school taught QBASIC in 1st grade and for some reason, my younger self was absolutely fascinated by these things. When I was 8 or 9, I spent almost an entire year in vain trying to get this game development kit I found in an old book in the school library to work. Why did I care so much about that? So I could eventually garner a six figure salary out of college? Of course, not.
4. Not only do I have 4 great offers, but I could easily get many more.  It's a position of privillege when people will spend hours with you trying to convince you to <em>just</em> interview for them.
5. See point 1.

Point is the trajectory of my life is one where I've only had moderate levels of control and yet, I've ended up in a really good position. A significant portion of my life has been due to luck, circumstances, accident of birth, etc. But of course, it's not all rosy cheeks and flowing champagne either:

1. Compared to most of my peers, I will leave college with a significant amount of debt. Since Stanford guarentees very good financial aid for all U.S. residents (need-blind admissions), most people carry very little debt. However, as an interantional student, I'm not eligible for this.
2. Another downside to not being a U.S. citizen is the restriction on my employment. Switching jobs is hard to do, you can only be unemployed for so many days. For instance, I would like to attend Hacker School, but I have no idea if that's even possible on an H1-B. Worst of all, starting my own company is hard.

If I did not have $60,000 worth of loans, and if I was a U.S. citizen, I would be doing my own company, not working for one.

I have it good, but not nearly as good as Obama's daughter or Larry Page's son or the sons and daughters of everyone rich and powerful. I still have to work. They don't. This last realization, despite being obvious, is not trivial. A question many people have dealt with at some point or other in their life is whether they have to spend their life constantly feeling grateful for everything. How do you even express constant gratitude? On this topic, Aaron Swartz's essay, <em>[Life in a World of Pervasive Immorality](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/immoral)</em>, is a really good read. 

Let us suppose you are a soon-to-be-college-graduate who is not arrogant (I hear there are a lot of entitled Ivy League pricks out there; this shouldn't concern them). I believe you ought to feel grateful.

But, gratitude for what? Towards whom?

Gratitude should be directed to all those people who helped you become who you are: parents, friends, teachers, mentors, etc. And all those other people who went and above beyond what they were expected to do in order to help you.

For everyone who has a shittier job than you do, for everyone who was born into squalor and did not have the oppurtunities you did, for everyone that's lower down the food chain than you (and there are billions of these people!), gratitude is not quite the right emotion. I can't find a word for it, but it's something like "I truly appreciate that I have it good, and I believe that you guys should have everything I have too". Perhaps also, "I *feel* you (as much as I can from my position)".

Self-interest, and exclusively self-interest, is the right attitude (at least, under professional circumstances) towards those higher up the food chain than you, which includes your employers. When you receive a job offer, and you think "That's good enough" or "I'm probably asking for more than I'm worth" or "I'm being greedy!", <strong>you have already been exploited</strong>. The people paying your salary are not doing out of the goodness of their heart. They are doing it so they can become richer. In particular, so they can become orders of magnitude richer than you.

Another prelevant view among many people I know is that startups are egalitarian organizations. They might be egalitarian in some aspects (technical decision-making, perhaps?). But if you know anything at all about cooperatives and wage slavery, you'd realize that startups are exploitative. They are surely nicer than traditional companies in that you get some share of the company. But you don't get a fair share, not even close. The founder-employee differential is needlessly and unfairly huge. Capital also takes a huge undeserved chunk of equity.

So, next time you think "I'm being greedy!", remember that the money you are taking is not coming from the wages of the person who cleans your toilets (they are already paid minimum wage), but from the gold lining the pockets of people who have so much gold only because they were luckier than you ever will be. *You* deserve everything you have. But always, thank those responsible for where you are with all of your heart. And never forget that there are billions of people not listening to Spotify Premium at this moment while receiving Snapchats. Instead, they are trying to figure out how they are going to find their next meal or they are dying from some terrible and completely preventable disease. That is real suffering. Help them as much as you can.
