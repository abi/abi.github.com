<em>Author's Note: I wrote this story in about an hour for [our weekly writing jam](http://mighty-eyrie-5812.herokuapp.com/jams/5). It has only been edited slightly since then (primarily, grammatical edits). I'm surprised by how much I like this story. I've been experimenting with a couple of techniques from the show Arrested Development in this piece.</em>

I wonder where my watch is. Fuck, I can't find my watch. I took it off when I was watching T.V. I wonder why I did that? Ohh, because I wanted to lay down on my back with my hands supporting my head so I could watch the T.V. The watch was hurting my head. The Seven Wonders of the World was on History channel. "The Taj Mahal is no seven-day wonder", the commentator was saying, "It took nearly forty years and thousands upon thousands to build this truly great wonder." I wonder if they had time-lapses back in the day. Well, of course not. But if they did, it would be so cool. Anyway, where the fuck is my watch? I have to leave in 2. But I could no go nowhere without my watch. No wonder I was always late to things. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, I mutter as I flip everything in the living room.

"Watch your mouth!", my mother yells. She's on the couch watching T.V. 
"Sorry ma, I really need to find my watch. Have you seen it lately?" 
"No. And small wonder. You need to get out of your head and stop being so absent-minded all the time." 
"Thanks for the lecture, ma. Thanks so much for watching over me." 
"Shut your mouth, young man. You're no seven-day wonder. You didn't just pop out of nowhere. We raised you. Me and your dad." 
"If only you had done a better job, right?" 
"That's enough, Abi." ... "Stop blocking the T.V."

She is hooked to this show that she tried to make me watch once. She told me that I'd enjoy it. I very much doubted it, of course. She cooked me and my brother a nice meal when we got home from school on the planned day. Even made us some hot chocolate. And she had us sitting in front of the TV at 4:30PM. Sharp. And boy was that the longest show I'd ever watched. Like watching paint dry.

My brother walks into the living room right then.

"Have you seen my watch?" I yell at him. 
"No, but listen to this song. It's so good." 
"I don't have time right now, Aswath. I have to run." 
"Come on, it's only 3 minutes." 
"No. Go away." 
"You go away!"

My brother is always listening to stupid poppy one-hit wonders. And never being helpful. Where the fuck is my watch? I wonder if I'll make it in time for the movie. Somebody is texting me. Now, somebody else is texting me. Or the same person. I don't know cos I'm still looking for the fucking watch.

The movie is going to start in 40 minutes. Well, more like 50 minutes since I don't care to watch the promo trailers anyway.

OK. OK. Think. So if it isn't near the couch or the T.V. Where could it be? Maybe at the dining table? Oh, yes yes yes. YES. Of course. I had been eating a watermelon this morning because my mom said that it would work wonders for my lingering cold. I must have removed the watch because the water from the melon would have been dripping all over it.

But. It's not on the dining table.

I figure maybe the maid or someone swept it under the table. So, I look underneath the table. There's a little sticker on the flipside of the table-top that once read "Watch your head". From back when me and my brother used to play underneath the table. My dad came up with <em>this</em> wonderful idea to keep us from getting injured. Or at least, that was his official word. Both, me and my brother knew that he was more annoyed that we gave him and Mom scares by hiding underneath and then, pouncing upon them to surprise them. We were little brats. My brother had gotten some white-out and a red pen, and made it read "Wat yo hood". Which we both thought was pretty funny back then. It kinda still is. But whatevers, my watch isn't fucking here either.

An evil idea pops into my head. It must be the maid. It's got to be. She would totally steal a watch. I go back to the living room.

"Mom, I think Lupe must have stolen my watch." 
"Lupe is wonderful. Plus I keep a close watch on her." 
"Of course, you do. You watch her like a hawk. I feel bad for her." 
"These people, you can never trust them." 
"Ma, you just said she was wonderful." 
"She is, when she's being watched over." ... "Also, don't forget to be back by seven thirty, you have to watch over your baby sister!" 
"Why?" 
"I have to take your brother to Taekwando class since your dad is going to be at work late."

Arghhh. Fuck this. WHERE THE FUCK IS MY WATCH.

The only reason I slash all my friends (at least, the guys) were going to watch this movie today was because Kerry Washington had been cast as Wonder Woman. I don't even give a fuck about the plot. So. Why don't I just stay home and watch some porn instead? Yeah, I'll just do that. That sounds so much better. Why go out for porn when you have the Internet? Yep.

I announce in the living room that I am going nowhere. My mother doesn't bat an eye. I am furious though with myself for having to cancel. I take out my phone and start texting my friends that I wasn't going to make it as I walk back to my room —

"Watch it!" yells my brother as I nearly crash into him in the hallway.

I shut the door to my room but my brother's music next door is really loud. All the better for my activities, I think.

I can hear the lyrics from his poppy crap:

*"By the people watching on the telly"*

Tuh-tah-taaah. Tuh-tah-taaah. Asha has sent me a couple of texts:

— "Watch your step if you're coming in late"  
— "It's a wonder I didn't die when I tripped on the stairs coming in"

I reply:

— "Not coming anymore. Have to watch over my baby sister :("

The singer is blaring through the walls:

*"Chances are you'll probably feel better  
If you stayed and played with yourself"*

I figure this must be a sign from the universe telling me to start playing with myself, and so, I start masturbating.

When I come, I come all over my watch.
