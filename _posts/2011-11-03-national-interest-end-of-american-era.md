A Harvard professor addresses the end of American ultra-dominance on the global stage from an American national interest perspective (emphasis mine). 

> Instead of seeking to dominate these regions directly, however, our first recourse should be to have local allies uphold the balance of power, out of their own self-interest. **Rather than letting them free ride on us, we should free ride on them as much as we can**, intervening with ground and air forces only when a single power threatens to dominate some critical region. For an offshore balancer, the greatest success lies in getting somebody else to handle some pesky problem, not in eagerly shouldering that burden oneself.
