title: Sharing an Intellectual Culture

---

{{ page.title }}
================

I was hanging out with some friends recently when...

"Oh look, his head is so much bigger than the feet", said someone pointing at a statue.
"I don't think that's true", retorted someone else.
"Yeah, I think you said that because blahblahblah was talking about big heads earlier." 
"Yeah, probably just priming." conceded the OP.

"Priming" is the key word here. A few years ago, I didn't know what priming was. But now, for some reason, we all did. None of us were psychologists. We were all CS/Math-types and we had all been immersed in the same culture. We read the same blogs. We thought about the same things. We knew what "priming" was and why it was appropriate here.

Point is there's so much intellectual culture that's shared between me and the people I hang out. This is a huge advantage. It means we can have arguments without having to define every word. We already have a solid base of knowledge that we agree on, or at the very least, we are aware of. With a foundation like this, it's so much easier to build on things. Of course, the base is not impenetrable to an outsider and it definitely shouldn't be. Starting from first principles is possible, but it's boring. Conversations shouldn't be boring.

A shared intellectual culture, which is what I'm going to call this phenomenon, is not always good though. I don't read too much LessWrong but once, I went to a LessWrong meetup (it was at a Singularity conference, and I wandered through during a break). I shook hands with the first guy I met, and the first question he asked was if I'd read the sequences. I said no, and he immediately lost interest in talking to me. I don't blame him. LessWrong has an incredibly deep shared intellectual culture. Without all that terminology and context, it would be incredlbly hard and boring for a LessWronger to argue with someone who wasn't one. Yet, such a situation is clearly bad. There are good reasons why we want everyone [to learn to code](code.org) and [understand math](http://worrydream.com/KillMath/), etc..

At some point, context and culture becomes nomenclature/jargon/classification and that's bad. It prevents motivated beginners for joining in on the fun. Especially because, beginners often create revolutions in thought because they haven't yet fallen into the established pitfalls.

I can't draw a line in the sand but. Shared culture is extremely vaiuable, and at the same time, jargon is bad.

So. If a shared culture doesn't exist among a group of people, can we create it? Let's set aside "intellectual culture" for a little bit and think about culture in a broader context. Suppose there are a ton of Big Lebowski references floating around the dinner table, if someone doesn't understand these references, she knows what to do: she gets on Netflix and starts watching Big Lebowski. Among cliques, there are more obscure references because the people in the group listen to the same music, watch the same TV, etc. and they also know that the others do too. If you want to become part of a clique, you consume the same art.

Intellectual culture needs an analogous process. There's definitely many recorded resources. One reason everyone knew about priming is because they read Hacker News or Less Wrong or some other similar site, and at least one of these sources is bound to talk about the idea of priming from time to time. But unlike "art", in the realm of ideas, there are many important ideas that are lost to conversation and never recorded permanently. Especially ideas that are formed by one person and never exposited outside their friends circle.

And this brings me to what prompted me to write this post. Earlier today, I sent [this article on writing](http://www.pixartouchbook.com/blog/2011/5/15/pixar-story-rules-one-version.html) to Grant and David. Grant replied,

> "The information density is so high that you really have to come back to it constantly and re-read over months it to get the most out of it.Â ".

And that got me really excited, because I've been thinking about "high information density things" quite a bit recently. Specifically, over the last week, I've been struggling with the problem of not being able to retain much of the good advice that I consume on the Internet. Should I leave my tab open so I can constantly get back to this? That's annoying, I hate having a ton of open tabs. It's a constant source of stress. Should I store this in a note? But then, I never read notes that I write. Should I put it far down my TODO list so next weekend when I clear my TODO list (I clean every weekend), I'll look at this?I haven't quite figured out a satisfactorily solution. But the idea of "high information density things" is really important and not something I've ever seen spelt out concretely before. There's a clear dichotomy between between these type of articles and other things that I read that I don't care to ever return to.

Next time someone talks about not being able to internatilize some good advice, there's so much context here. If Grant wrote a blogpost about this or if I did, I could simply talk about it for a little while and then, point to his blogpost.

"Oh, look this is another high information density article!"

Ideas are hugely important, having the right idea in your head really changes the way you think about the world. Here's an idea about ideas: think of them as lenses, and everytime you hear a new idea, it's as if you have been gifted with a new lens unlike any you had before. Maybe it's a different color, or it turns the world upside down or it superimposes fractals on everything. Take this lens and keep it safely in a lens box. And just by doing that, you've added a whole new, exciting way to view the world. Now imagine, If we all shared our lens box that we hide inside our impenetrable heads, we'd have all the best lenses! And so many more ways to view the world.

Conclusion
----------

1. All my friends should blog: To create permanent records of ideas
2. All my friends should read all my other friend's blog: so we can share a basis of knowledge from which to debate things
