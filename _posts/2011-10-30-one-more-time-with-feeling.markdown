After a long hiatus, 'tis time to blog again. The world is a quite a different world since the last time I blogged with any regularity. 2011 and blogging is no longer so new or even cool. Facebook isn't just a website anymore. Our lives and the web are all mixed together. Offline and online are one.

We are as much our thoughts as we are our body.
