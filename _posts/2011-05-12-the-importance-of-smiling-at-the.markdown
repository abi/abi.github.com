*We'll end up numb from playing video games  
and we'll get sick of having sex.  
And we'll get fat from eating candy    
as we drink ourselves to death.  
We'll stay up late  
making mix tapes,photoshoping pictures of ourselves
while we masturbate to these pixelated videos
of strangers fucking themselves.

We are very busy people,
We are very busy people.

There's crusty socks
and stacks of pizza boxes
making trails straight to the bed.
And when we're done sleeping
we'll stay busy dreaming of the things
we don't have yet.
Well there's a long, long list of chores
and shit to do before we play, 
oh let's just piss away the day.(piss away the day)
Crank call the cops down at the station,
just for friendly conversation,
requesting songs they never play;
Let's hear the one that goes like:

We are very busy people,
We are very busy people;
But we've always got time for new friends.

So come on over and knock on our door,
it's open whatchu waitin' for?
We might be sprawled out on the floor,
but we still make lovely company.
Pull up a chair, I'll pour some tea,
We'll shoot the shit, 'bout everything,
till you get sick of politics,
and flip on the TV screen,
we stare at the TV screen.
That Donnie Darko DVD has been repeating for a week,
and we know every single word.
(Every single word).
I've got an iPod like a pirate ship,
I'll sail the seas
with fifty thousand songs I've never heard-
And all the best of them go
Fa la la la la la...
Fa la la la la la...

We are very busy people,
We are very busy people;
But we've always got time for new friends.
Yeah.
Fa la la la la la...
Fa la la la la la...
