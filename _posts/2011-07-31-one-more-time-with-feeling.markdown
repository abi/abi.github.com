After a while, it's time to blog again. It's 2011 and blogging is no longer blogging. Facebook isn't a website anymore.
Our lives and the web are all mixed together. Life offline and online merges and we are transported. We are our thoughts.

Blogging is writing. Writing is understanding. Understanding is love. And love makes the world a better place.
